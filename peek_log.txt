Lila and Ben were very happy. They were going to the festival with Mom and Dad. The festival had many fun things to do. There were balloons, games, music, and food.
Lila and Ben saw a big swing. They wanted to try it. They ran to the swing and asked Mom and Dad.
"Can we go on the swing, please?" they said.
"Sure, you can," Mom said. "But you have to wait your turn. There are other kids on the swing now."
Lila and Ben waited patiently. They watched the other kids go up and down on the swing. They looked excited and scared.
Soon, it was their turn. Mom and Dad paid the man who ran the swing. The swing was cheap. It only cost one coin for each kid.
Lila and Ben got on the swing. They put on their belts and held on tight. The man pushed a button and the swing started to move.
Lila and Ben felt a rush of wind in their faces. They felt their stomachs go funny. They screamed and laughed.
"Weee! This is so fun!" Lila said.
"I love the swing!" Ben said.
They swung higher and higher. They saw the whole festival from the air. They saw the balloons, the games, the music, and the food. They also saw Mom and Dad waving at them.
Lila and Ben had a great time on the swing. They did not want to stop. But the swing had to stop. The man said it was time for the next kids.
Lila and Ben got off the swing. They thanked the man and ran to Mom and Dad.
"That was awesome!" Lila said.
"Can we go again?" Ben said.
"Maybe later," Mom said. "There are other fun things to do at the festival. Let's go and see."
Lila and Ben nodded. They followed Mom and Dad to the next attraction. They were still smiling and happy. They loved the festival. And they loved the swing.

Tom and Mia were playing in the living room. They had many toys and cushions to make a fort. They liked to pretend they were brave knights and princesses.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar from outside. They looked out the window and saw a big, fierce lion. It had yellow fur and sharp teeth. It was walking towards their house.
"Oh no, a lion!" Mia said. "What do we do?"
"Don't be scared, Mia. I have an idea," Tom said. He grabbed a cushion and waved it in the air. "Hey, lion, look at me! I have a magic cushion. It can make you go away!"
The lion saw Tom and the cushion. It was curious and confused. It stopped and tilted its head. It wondered what the cushion was.
Tom and Mia saw their chance. They ran to the door and opened it. They shouted for their mom and dad. "Help, help, there's a lion outside!"
Their mom and dad came quickly. They saw the lion and the cushion. They were surprised and scared. They called the animal control to take the lion away.
Tom and Mia hugged their mom and dad. They were glad they were safe. They thanked Tom for his clever idea. They also thanked the cushion for being a good friend. They decided to keep the cushion in their fort. They hoped the lion would find a nice home. They never forgot their adventure with the fierce lion and the magic cushion.

Tom and Sue are twins. They like to play in the attic. The attic is full of old things. Some things are ancient. Ancient means very, very old.
One day, they find a big box. The box is dusty and heavy. They open the box. Inside, they see many shiny things. They see coins, rings, necklaces, and a lamp. The lamp is ancient. It has a bulb on top.
"Wow, look at this lamp!" Tom says. He picks up the lamp and rubs it. He wants to see if it works.
"Be careful, Tom. It might be broken," Sue says. She is afraid of the dark. She wants to go back downstairs.
Suddenly, the bulb flashes. A puff of smoke comes out of the lamp. Tom and Sue are scared. They drop the lamp and hide behind the box.
"Hello, hello. Who are you?" a voice says. The voice is loud and strange. Tom and Sue peek from behind the box. They see a man. The man is big and blue. He has a long beard and a turban. He is smiling.
"I am the genie of the lamp. You have freed me from my prison. I am very grateful. I will grant you three wishes. Anything you want, I can do," the man says.
Tom and Sue are amazed. They have never seen a genie before. They have read about them in books. They wonder what to wish for.
"Can you make us fly?" Tom asks. He wants to fly like a bird.
"Can you make us rich?" Sue asks. She wants to have all the shiny things.
"Of course, of course. Anything you want. But be careful what you wish for. Sometimes, wishes can have consequences," the genie says. He snaps his fingers. Tom and Sue feel a tingling in their feet. They look down. They see wings on their shoes. They look at each other. They smile. They are ready to fly.

John was really tired after playing all day. He went inside and saw a big bowl of ice-cream. He was so happy, because he really loved ice-cream!
John wanted to eat it, but he remembered that no one had asked him if it was ok. He thought it might be better to ask first, so he asked his mom if he could have some ice-cream.
His mom shook her head. She said she was sorry, but if he wanted ice-cream, he should have asked sooner. She said that if he wanted ice-cream, he would have to wait until tomorrow and only if he had been careful.
John was disappointed. He was so tired and he wanted the ice-cream right now. He went to bed without eating any ice-cream at all.

Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the library with her mom. The library was full of books. Lily loved to look at the colorful pictures in the books.
One day, Lily saw a big boy crying in the library. She went to him and asked, "Why are you sad?" The big boy looked at her and said, "I can't find my book. I am ashamed because I lost it." Lily wanted to help him.
Lily and the big boy looked for the book together. They asked the library lady for help. The library lady answered, "I found your book! It was under the table." The big boy was happy, and he said "thank you" to Lily and the library lady. Lily was happy too, because she made a new friend.

Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty chair that she loved to sit on. One day, Lily saw a small flower in her yard. She was very excited and wanted the flower to bloom.
Lily was very patient. She watered the flower every day and talked to it. "Please bloom, little flower," she said. The flower listened to her and grew a little bit every day.
One sunny day, the flower finally bloomed. It was a beautiful red flower. Lily was so happy that she ran inside to tell her mom. "Mom, the flower bloomed! It's so pretty!" she said. Her mom smiled and said, "You were very patient, Lily. Good job!" Lily felt proud and knew that being patient helped the flower bloom.

Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She wanted to win the noisy meeting, so she put on her favourite dress and ran quickly to the meeting.
When she arrived, she saw that all the other children had beautiful costumes too. She felt a little nervous, but she thought of something special and waved her arms like a butterfly.
Suddenly, everyone in the room clapped. She had won the noisy meeting!
Lucy smiled and said, "Yay! I won!"
The other children cheered and praised her. Lucy beamed with joy and hugged everyone in the room.
And that was how Lucy won the noisy meeting.

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to imagine things. One day, he imagined a big island. The island had trees, sand, and water all around it. Tim wanted to go there and play.
Tim got on a boat and went to the island. He played in the sand, swam in the water, and climbed the trees. He had a lot of fun. He saw birds, fish, and even a crab. The crab was funny and played with Tim.
After a long day, Tim was tired. He sat under a tree and ate some fruit. The sun went down and the sky was pretty. Tim smiled and knew he had a great day on the island. He couldn't wait to imagine more fun places to go.

One day, a little boy named Tim found some gum on the ground. He thought it was a fun toy, so he picked it up and played with it. The gum was hard, but Tim didn't mind. He liked the way it felt in his hands.
Tim's mom saw him playing with the gum and said, "Tim, that's yucky! We need to wipe your hands clean." Tim didn't want to stop playing with the gum, but he knew his mom was right. So, he let her wipe his hands with a wet cloth.
After his hands were clean, Tim's mom gave him a new toy to play with. It was a big, soft ball. Tim loved the ball even more than the hard gum. He played with it all day, and he didn't miss the gum at all.

John was a brave boy. He wanted to save his village from the big tank. Every day he looked out his window and saw the dark tank, but one morning he spotted something.
It was a small package with a note. The note said: "John, you can save us. Take this package and send it into the bitter tank."
John was scared but he knew what he had to do. He grabbed the package and headed towards the tank. He held his breathe and sent the package in.
Suddenly, the tank began to rumble and shake. It suddenly lifted off the ground, and little sparks flew out. A few seconds later, it was gone!
John was surprised and ran back to the village. Everyone was so happy that the battle was won and cheered John for his bravery. John had sent the package into the tank and it had saved the village from harm.

Once upon a time, there was a sweet girl named Lily. She had a pet cat named Fluffy. Lily and Fluffy liked to play outside in the sun. They would step and jump and run all day long. They were very happy.
One day, they saw a big box. Lily and Fluffy were very curious. They wanted to see what was inside the box. They went to the box and Lily tried to open it. She pulled and pulled, but the box would not open.
Then, something unexpected happened. The box began to shake and move. Lily and Fluffy were scared. They tried to step back, but it was too late. The box opened and a big, mean dog jumped out. The dog chased Lily and Fluffy. They ran and ran, but the dog was too fast. They could not get away.
In the end, the dog caught Lily and Fluffy. The dog was not nice. He took them to his home and made them stay there. Lily and Fluffy were very sad. They missed their home and their fun days in the sun.

One day, a little girl named Sue went outside to play. The sun was shining and she was very happy. She saw her friends gather near a big tree. They were talking about their toys. Sue wanted to join them, but she could not find her umbrella. She looked everywhere for it. She asked her mom if there was an available umbrella she could use.
Her mom gave her a big umbrella. Sue took the umbrella and went to the tree where her friends were. They were all having fun together. Suddenly, the sky got dark and it started to rain. All the kids ran to find a place to hide from the rain. Sue opened her big umbrella and called her friends to come under it.
All her friends came under Sue's umbrella. They were so happy that Sue had the umbrella. They thought the rain would stop their fun, but instead, they had more fun under the umbrella. They sang songs and played games while waiting for the rain to stop. The big umbrella saved the day and made their playtime even better.

Her dad smiled and said, "That is a fishing rod, played with by a fisherman. I bet if we pull it on some bait, we can see a fish!"
Amber got so excited. She took the rod and put the bait on it. Then she started to pull it back and forth in the water.

Once upon a time there was a bird who wanted to see a sunset. The day was cold, so the bird shivered as it flew. It was looking for the sun but it seemed so far away.
The bird flew for a long time, until it saw the sun setting in the distance. But as the bird watched, something strange happened. The sun got smaller and smaller until it disappeared.
The bird was so surprised that it could hardly believe its eyes. The sun had shrunk and gone away! That night the bird tucked itself into its nest with a feeling of wonder.
The next morning, the sun reappeared and the bird's heart filled with joy. The bird had seen a sunset, and it was the most beautiful thing it had ever seen.

"It's okay, Sara, it's okay. I know you did not mean to break the vase. But you have to be careful. You can't touch things that are not yours. You can't polish things that are not shoes. Do you understand?"
Sara nods. She understands. She is still sorry. She wipes her tears. She says sorry again.
Mommy kisses her forehead. She says she loves her. She says they will clean up the mess together. She says they will find another vase. She says they will call grandma and tell her what happened.
Sara feels better. She loves mommy. She helps mommy clean up the mess. She says she will not touch things that are not hers. She says she will only polish her shoes. She says she will be a good helper.

The wife said, "I want to try too!" She held out her hand with some seeds. The adorable little bird looked at them and then flew down. It ate the seeds from the wife's hand and the bread from the man's hand.
They both were happy to see the bird eat from their hands. They smiled and said, "We did it! We made a new friend!" The adorable little bird sang a pretty song for them and then flew away. The man and his wife went home, feeling happy about their day at the park.

Once upon a time, there was a little train. The train was very good at making steam. It would puff and puff as it went down the tracks. It was a bit scary for some animals, but the train was friendly.
One day, the train met a small bird. The bird was scared of the train's steam. The train told the bird, "Do not be scared. I am a nice train. I believe we can be friends." The bird looked at the train and then at the steam. The bird was still a little scared.
But the train was very kind. It made a small puff of steam, so the bird would not be scared. The bird saw that the train was not so scary after all. The bird believed the train, and they became good friends. They played together every day, and the bird was never scared of the train's steam again.
